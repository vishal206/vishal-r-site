- Travelled to Kolkata, will cover the experience in a blog.

- Before travelling, I have been busy with plans and actions for the coming year 2026. Below are some,

- **Trips for 2026**: Here I have planned out when I‘m gonna meet my parents, my favorite relative, and take trips. This goes like, I visit Chennai, Coimbatore, and the trip place for respective 3 months, then take a break month. For the trip, planning for Mysore, Varkala, and Kannur.

- **Hobbies of 2026**: This is not exactly a hobby, but the things I want to learn or master this year. I came up with Drawing, Learning Hindi, and Dance. One hobby per 4 months. I have already bought a tablet for drawing, but never got serious, but for the 4 four months I will take it seriously and get my flow to continue the rest of my life. Learning Hindi is to crack jokes with all my Hindi friends.

- **Buy list**: A priority list of items I need to buy. This will be added to the months, so that I don’t overspend in a month. As I’m planning trips, I should keep my budget in check.

- Will be writing **2 blogs a month**.
