Yo! In week 14,

- Went to the gym after a week of vacation 🏋️‍♂️
- Cooked sambar after ages, and it came out so perfect — even the rice was cooked to perfection 🍚✨
- Started the book _“Goodbye to Inflammation.”_ 📖

- Brought back my habits of **reading, writing, and going to the gym**.

- Wrote about my new project in the devlog. While writing it, I realized that I was not on track. Whatever I was doing was off from the core of my idea, which brought me back to re-writing the development roadmap.

- As for my morning routine, I’m going to the gym on **alternate days**, and on the other days I’m going to focus on **learning to draw** 🎨.
