- Only thing I did on Monday and Tuesday is to wait for Wednesday, as Wed and Thur are holidays that come with a long weekend with Friday as WFH.  
- Went to Orion Mall to checkout the newly opened Uniqlo and Lego store, first timer to both. Got 3 custom-built Lego characters. One is resting with my Hot Wheels now, named him the Lanister.  
- Uniqlo goes a long way for me as I got to know about it when I was searching for boxed t-shirts, and they were the only ones that got a proper one. Always waited for them to enter the Indian market. Love their brand history, how they spend equally on research and development on the fabrics.  
- Holidays make Bangalore hell-a-crowded. Why are Indians (we) so loud? Is it a population problem or a culture problem? Ended up getting a headache due to the noise.  
- No meetings on WFH as the majority of the team was OOO (yayyy 🥳).  
- Tried Belgium Waffle place for the first time, damnnn I'm a fan of their waffles now.  
- In the indie web club, explored weekly notes and building in public. Gonna try out these weekly notes and start posting about Wesaige (personal project) regularly as a Devlog at regular intervals.
