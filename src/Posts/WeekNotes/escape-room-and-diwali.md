- Celebrated the **1-year anniversary of the 11 AM Club**, started with paper cutting where the creativity juice flows. I couldn't finalize what to make, every cut I made gave me a new idea. Anyway, I ended up with a unique-looking piece by the end. As usual, Bake Duck got an exquisite cake, this time an even more special one for the anniversary, a **chocolate blueberry cake** 🤤.  

- I dream of building a wardrobe where I have solid oversized (boxy) t-shirts and solid pants. This is the minimal look I want to maintain in the office, and when I'm going out, I want a collection of jackets I can throw on top of these solids. Went to add another solid t-shirt, but maybe due to the Diwali season, I couldn’t find anything good. Tried GAP, no luck, tbh, not much collection. Then tried this new place **Marks & Spencer (M&S)**, found a very nice full-sleeve t-shirt with a collar. Loved the color, stitching was perfect, packed it.  

- Never ordering onion pakoda in Avan Thindi again 😤, it was dry af and too much to eat. Regretted it so badly.  

- Went home by train, so lucky I got a single seat 🕺.  

- Day 1 at home — Ordered parota, different varieties: prawn kili parota, kothu parota, and mutton curry. Home-cooked sambar. **Stomach full**.  

- Day 2 at home — Tried Escape Room for the first time with cousins. Damn, it was crazy fun! Made a **pact** to go to an escape room every time I come home. Made my cousins try Japanese food. Came back to prawn and crab meal. **Stomach full**.  

- Day 3 & 4 at home — Nothing much, played cricket in the hall, badminton with brother and his friends. Mom cooked my favorite fish curry and fish fry. **Stomach full**.  

- Day 5 at home — Happy Diwali! Wasn’t planning to burst crackers but got convinced after seeing neighbor kids run to the rooftop. Burst some crackers, watched a movie, and had bucket biryani. **Stomach full**.
