Yo! 🙋‍♂️ In week 18,

- My colleagues and my coleges were discussing OpenClaw AI and the fun of Moltbook. We started discussing a fantasy future with humans totally being replaced by AI in a good way. Which leaded as to one another to aamchi ice cream 👀. Yes, we had it thanks to quick commerce.
- Went to Burma Burma Restaurant & Tea Room for a team outing. I have had Burmese street food, which gives a Burmese feel to it, even with the naming. Disappointed, But here it felt like an usual asian foods.
