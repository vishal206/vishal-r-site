Yo!

As per my trip goals for this year, I went to Chennai to celebrate Pongal. This was an educational trip, as I was requested to teach my brother the NCERT. He is jee aspirant and has cleared Olympiads. But he has no interest in opening an NCERT book. So I had to summarize some lessons and motivate him to read these books just for the next two weeks until the final exams.

Did try to add a personal chatbot to this site. Created the embedding and answering bot. Here, I used Firestore ( not a typical one ) to store my embedding. But got stuck when trying to make it live. I was using ollama to run the LLM locally. Not sure how to move it to Firebase functions and run it. Not sure how to run the API. This forced me to stop the production. Should I continue?

_Should I opt for a cloud llm like OpenAI or Gemini?_ But it will cost 😭

Then started a **streak manager** web app. Front end is almost done. Planning to learn C # and implement it for the backend.

How can there be a home visit without a theater visit! I think this is my family’s easiest family outing that everyone enjoys.

**Theater>>>Restaurant**, Even if we go to a restaurant, it doesn’t feel fulfilling unless we hit the theater and watch a “family-friendly movie”. We went to TTT ( Thalaivar Thambi Thalimaiil ), a light-hearted comedy drama. This movie is Perfect. The emotions worked so well, especially with a side character, the groom, I was amazed how the movie made us understand the feeling of a goofy non-so main character.
As always, a simple story with a good screenplay wins.
