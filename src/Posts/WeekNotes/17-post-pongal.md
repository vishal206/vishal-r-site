Yo! 🙋‍♂️ In week 17,

- My parents stay in 3rd floor of the apartment whenever my brother leaves for school, my mom stays near the stairs and looks down to check if he leaves safely.
  That felt so beautiful. So that day, I left the flat, took the lift. Once I reached the ground floor, I wondered if my mom was up there looking at me. Guess what! she was there ( and my brother too ). I will be cherishing this moment forever 💖.
- Returned back to Bangalore.
- Attended my usual Writer's Room, which was the reader's room this month. And attended my **last SwapBook** Club meet-up. It's great that we get to discuss all about our current read and the book we are giving for swapping, but the environment puts pressure on me, expecting me to talk something poetic about my read. The problem is that most of the time, I only feel "This is a good book with a nice plot". It’s hard to always have something great to say about it. I decided to quit this club; this will be my last day there.

- On sunday I went to Karigar Bazaar. The usual suspect. It was crowded. Found some good eating bowls. Bought a pair. Never knew I would appreciate a bowl to eat my lunch, but it’s a pleasure for my hands when I wash it ( so easy to clean compared to plates ).
- Tried a new cafe in Cunningham Road, Infini Tea ( a lame name ). Ordered a steak breakfast plate. It was good, but I can’t stop comparing it to the cafe I went to in Kolkata, **Abar Baithak 🤤** , damn this place might be the only reason for me to visit Kolkata again.
