Yo! 🙋‍♂️ In week 17,

- My parents stay in 3rd floor of the apartment whenever my brother leaves for school, my mom stays near the stairs and looks down to check if he leaves safely.
  That felt so beautiful. So Today I left the flat, took the lift. Once I reached the ground floor, I wondered if my mom was up there looking at me. Guess what! she was there ( and my brother too ). I will be cherishing this moment forever.
- Returned back to Bangalore
