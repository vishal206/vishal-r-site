 Hi! Welcome to my Weekly Note nummbbberrr 8 ✨

- On Monday, the usual walk in church street after lunch, I saw an unusual crowd surrounding a camera crew. First, I thought it was some YouTube channel; sometimes I have seen Times Now, but never a crowd around it. Then they all started dancing, ahaa, it’s shooting, and I spotted a known face. It was GV Prakash. Even though not a fan of his acting, my childhood was filled with his music. Felt good to see him in person.

- If you have been to Vasanth Nagar’s Third Wave coffee! If so, do you know they got a chessboard table? 🫨 Played and lost after a long time.

- After 6 years of my journey with my HP laptop, give him his well-deserved retirement. And got a Mac Air m4 13’’ 10-core CPU 10-core GPU 16GB 512GB storage from the Reliance store in Vasanth Nagar after trying other resellers. They have better deals; check it out if you go that way.

- Went to Lalbagh after a year. Luckily, we were at the time of the waterfall( artificial one). And also, finally, the Chinese plant area was open. I should have gone there more than I did; maybe next year I will plan to go to parks more. 

- I got Arthur Weasley’s flying car Lego set 🕺.
