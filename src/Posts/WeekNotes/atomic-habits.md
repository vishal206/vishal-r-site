- After 10 days of going to the gym, my body is starting to adjust with all the muscle activation. There was a day when I felt like skipping it but then realized how much better I feel after going to the gym. Still working on the day routine.  

- Current morning routine starts with one competitive programming question, then head to the gym, then get ready for office.  

- I’ve crossed my max streak on LeetCode this year — it was 5, now it’s 7! Would like to keep the streak going.  

- One thing I want to build here is an **enjoyable process**. I’ve noticed I feel good when I go to the gym or when I solve a problem on LeetCode, I want to keep it that way.  
  In case there’s a day I don’t feel like going to the gym, I’m planning to just head there and do a basic warm-up — same goes for LeetCode.  
  I know the goal is to get fit and get better at competitive programming, but I still want to focus on the process — the act of showing up every day.  

- Got the sad news that my 11th-grade math teacher, MRR (I guess), passed away. R.I.P.  
  Still remember the joke he made when I told him my native village — “Oh! That place where you can see America from!”.  

- Cooked carrot poriyal for the first time. I’m a damn good cook.
