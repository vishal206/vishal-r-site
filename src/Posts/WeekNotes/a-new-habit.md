- Feeling proud that I didn’t take any leave this week even though none of my teammates showed up. One thing that stopped me is that this month I already had 5 office closures, so I’m planning to save the leaves for next month (no office closures 😭).  

- My personal laptop went down; when opened, the taskbar was missing, and I couldn’t open any apps. With the help of ChatGPT, I figured out that it was a **system crash**. No luck with the classic turn-off-and-on method. Had to restart in **safe mode** and type a huge command in the terminal, which finally fixed the issue.  
I remember getting a similar issue 4 years back, and I couldn’t get proper help from HP support, so I had to take it to the service center, which took days to fix. It’s surprising how **LLMs have changed our lives**, they’re truly making everyone more independent.  

- Joined the **gym**! First day, the trainer made me do pull-ups, and now I can’t even open my hands. Walking around like a robot. Took me a day to realize my body was telling me to drink more water, makes sense since I’m sweating more than usual. Still, I don’t want to give up; I’m going to the gym, but skipped the pull-ups.
