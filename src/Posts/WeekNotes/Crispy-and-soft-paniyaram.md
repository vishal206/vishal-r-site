Hi! Welcome to my Weekly Note nummbbberrr 9 💐🥟🤾‍♂️

- I’m writing this so late that half of what happened I've forgotten. I usually use my mobile gallery to recollect it. From that reference, I see only one day from my weekends.

- Starting with the Cubbon Park flower show, for someone who is stuck with dark mode, this felt so charming to my eye. So many vibrant colors, I took some micro photos. (🤔: _I should set up adding photos to my blogs and notes_).

  Apart from flowers, a lot of stalls, man lot of stalls. Spotted a Karnataka native sweet stall, asked them to pack everything, it was so good that I regretted not finding the names before they hit my stomach. Had paniyaram after a long time, crispy out and soft inside, damn, this might be the highlight of this week.

- Then, headed to the Writer’s Room, as usual, I continued on my blogs and presented them later, plus suggested that the group visit Cubbon Flower Show. Then an unusual thing happened. We played Pickleball 🕺. As someone who loves to play physical games, I was showing my teeth all over the game 😁.
