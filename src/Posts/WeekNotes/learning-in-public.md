- Attended my first Open Source India event, sat through 2 days of lectures. Learned a lot, I took notes for almost 20 pages. Aiming to make a blog/notebook going through details on what I understood and what I learned.  
- Attended a new book club, **SwapBook**. The bunch was so smart, everyone knew a lot about books, and the talk motivated me to add a new habit to my list: to read books while commuting in the metro daily.  
- This is the first time I'm mentioning this, I record a video diary and post it privately on YouTube. Now that I got new earbuds with a good mic, I was able to take videos from different angles and distances. Yesterday, I did a very cool video. These videos probably won't go public, but they help me get comfortable. In case I start a YouTube channel, I’ll be prepared.
