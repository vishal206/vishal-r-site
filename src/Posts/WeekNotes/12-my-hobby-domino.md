So what happened this week ( 12 ),

- I messed up my routine - gym, competitive programming, and reading.

- Things were all over the place, and I couldn’t pull myself to work on my project. I started a new project, should start a devlog on it. This mess is associated with the time I come home. I have been taking outings after office, which makes me late to home, and like a nice little domino, all the hobie routine collapsed.

- I added reading a book at night hobby. Which made me rest the mobile outside my bedroom, which resulted in waking up late and messing up the gym and CP routine in the morning.

- Will get an alarm clock (analog). Fix the sleep routine. Fill comes straight home after the office.
