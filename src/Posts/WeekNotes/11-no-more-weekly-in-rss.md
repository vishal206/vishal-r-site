Here is my week 11,

- Nothing happened this week. I want to use this week to reflect on what happened this week, the good and bad decisions I made this week.

- As it's more gonna be about “me”. I don’t see this adding any value to the reader, so I’m gonna stop posting it in my RSS.

- I will continue writing it and will be available on my site.

- If there is any update in my life, I will add it as a blog under the “Life” tag.
