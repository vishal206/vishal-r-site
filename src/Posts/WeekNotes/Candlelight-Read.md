Yo! Welcome to my Weekly Note nummbbberrr 10 🕯️📕

- Have you ever tried to fix your sleep routine? I too tried. This week, I came up with the idea of “candlelight read”.

  Sharp at 10:30 pm, I turn off all the lights and fans, light up my candles & open the window, and I read my book. After like 30 to 40 mins of reading, I hit the bed, and I feel more relaxed than I have ever been. Like those school days when you finish scribbling your record note and hit the bed!😌. I have been following this for 3 days now, and I hope I follow this through. I still have to come up with cases like when I’m out late 😶‍🌫️.

- Got a New Balance 530, wonder why I didn’t get it sooner. Anyone planning to buy comfortable shoes, beware of having mesh coming on top of ur toes. I have an Adidas Ozweego in which the toe part is full mesh, and my big toe says hi to the world now. This is not only with mine, but I’m noticing a lot of mesh shoes with a toe window on. 530 also has a mesh, but it has a protective line over your big toe. Practically, this should protect the mesh from coming apart.

  I tried the Asics 1130, also got a protective line, but it missed the spot a bit. Didn’t want to take a risk on it.
