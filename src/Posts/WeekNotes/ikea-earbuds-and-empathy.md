- Got my **IKEA delivery!** Finally received the ALGANÄS shoe stand that I’d been waiting for quite some time , loved it! I was afraid it would be *wobbly-wobbly* 😅 but it turned out super steady and slim, so it doesn’t take up much space.  
  Also grabbed a few other small things along with two cardboard boxes (VATTENTRÅG) , they look like shoe boxes but are *so neat* as organizers for my small closet.  

- Had a calm and beautiful Friday WFH. Got my clothes washed and dried in the sun. The clouds were so pretty. Cooked myself an omelet that came out fluffy and yellow (*just like cafés do!*) , had it with curd rice, damn 🤌  

- The same day, my **Realme Buds Air 6 Pro** got delivered. The mic is superb, ANC is decent, and I loved the audio quality. Honestly, not a *huge* difference from Realme 3 in terms of sound, but the other features were great , the dual connection and how it pauses automatically when I remove one side and switches to transparency mode. Love it!  

- Took a coding contest on LeetCode , solved 2 out of 4! Last time it was just 1 out of 4, so hey, that’s an improvement 😌.  

- Contradicting all the calmness I had this week, there was one bad experience. **Church Street really needs proper pedestrian crossings.** 🚸
  Me and my friend were trying to cross the road with a group of people , even though there were many crossing, one car wouldn’t stop honking 😤. It panicked my friend, she rushed, fell on the road, and hurt her leg and finger.  
  Why is everyone in such a rush? What’s that car gonna gain by saving 2 seconds? Why can’t people have empathy for those crossing the road? Has he never crossed a road himself?  
  Not just that , even in the metro, people rush to check out instead of standing in line. What are they going to gain in 10 seconds?! Why are people always in such a hurry! 🫠
