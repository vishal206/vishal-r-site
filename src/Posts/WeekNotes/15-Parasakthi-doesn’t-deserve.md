Yo! Week 15,

Had a micro war with my friend over choosing the WhatsApp group profile. She wanted Jungkook, while I wanted a cutie Kim Jong Un. It went back and forth and finally settled on common ground — a cat picture.

**Parasakthi doesn’t deserve this hatred.**

I watched Parasakthi and found it to be a decent film with several well-executed scenes. My main reason for watching it was the director, Sudha Kongara. Her film _Soorarai Pottru_ is a comfort watch for me, so I naturally expected Parasakthi to be on a similar level.

Both films are loosely inspired by real people and their real ambitions, but Parasakthi falls short in one key area. For nearly 40% of the film, the story drifts away from its core purpose. If the protagonist, Che, had been given a single, clear goal and the narrative had stayed focused on it, the film would have been far more effective.

Instead, the story diverts into his pursuit of a central government job. While this eventually helps him understand the flaws in the system, it introduces too many sub-goals that pull the film into unnecessary side tracks.

That said, apart from this structural issue, I felt the movie worked reasonably well. It is far from perfect — **but it is definitely not a film that deserves the level of hatred it is receiving.**
