 Hi! Welcome to my Weekly Note nummbbberrr 7 ✨

- This week I went **go-karting** for the first time. My great friends Sadhana and Mayank took me to **LOCO BEAR**. During a break, Mayank asked, “Let’s go for karting.” I acted casually “Sure, Sadhana, you’re coming too” but damn, my heart was on fire. I’ve read *Initial D* and *Over Rev!*, I’m high on cars and drifting story mangas, and I’ve watched enough *Fast & Furious* movies to crave revving a car.

  At around 9 PM, we landed at LOCO BEAR. They said we get only 8 minutes of drive time. I thought, *What? How much can someone drive in 8 minutes?* I was sad, but I couldn’t wait.  
  The time came, I wore the helmet and neck gear. Saw a huge line of karts and got mine: **number 17**. The only thing I was worried about was the boiling tank next to my elbow, and also making sure I didn’t press the brake and accelerator at the same time 😭.

  Everyone started. I was in the last kart. Once I went off the pit, it stopped. I was like *whaaaat?* Then they started the engine again. Then **vrooooooommmmmm** — no, actually, I went a bit slow in my first lap, wanted to scan the line.  
  The track was 3D. They had ups and downs. It was hard to go up, so I decided to accelerate right from the turn before the slope. Then the down was a free fall.  

  The next round, I went **vroooooommmm**, still frightened of the curves. Took me a round to understand how to tackle them, I should find the racing line and accelerate. Once I got that, I went **vrooooooommmm** again.  
  But I knew the people I was driving with were super good; they all overtook me. I didn’t mind, was happy to see Mayank competing with the stranger group.

  I overtook *1* guy from the stranger group. Damn, it was close. He was slow at a curve, I had to sharp turn and I felt so proud of my driving skills 😎. Once I got a chance to do a sharp right and left like I see in F1, damnnnn it felt great 🔥.

  The last lap came; everyone with a flag shouted LAST LAAAPP. I was like: *more vrooooommmmm!*  
  On the slope up, I saw Sadhana stopped. Good thing it was the slope, so I was anyway slow. I thought of getting out of my kart and checking if she was hurt, but that would’ve been more of a hindrance on the track, so I did the fastest **vrooooommmm** to get help, but she was fine. she reached the pit.

  This was one of my greatest 8 minutes ❤️‍🔥.

- Saturday I went to stores to enquire about the Mac M4 Air price. As I’m going to Mall of Asia next Saturday, I’ll check out the official Apple Store there and compare prices. I’ll buy the Mac by that Saturday.

- Attended IndieWebClub. It was technical, and I got a chance to set up RSS and add it to IndieWebClub’s OPML. Now people can read my blogs, weekly notes, and devlogs in an RSS reader. YaaaY!
