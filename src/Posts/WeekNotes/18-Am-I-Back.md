Yo! 🙋‍♂️ In week 18,

- Even though I was vibing around, there has been pounding in my heart. I have been looking for new jobs and have not getting any callbacks. No luck even after getting referrals. It has made me feel less about myself, and the pressure is hard to take on.
- This week I realized that there is no point in just being stuck and applying, I’m thinking of going back to my usual life of blogging, gyming, and along with it I will regularly apply and try for job. Don’t want to make it the only thing. I need to be calmer about it.
- I continued working on projects and scrapped some projects. I fixed on an idea of building a Hot Wheels haul. Where people create their peg and add HWs they are in search of and HWs they are ready to trade.
- Recently, I learnt C# and ASP.NET, planning to implement them in my new projects. Then explore Docker.
- And will go back to my wish list of learning Quantum computing.
