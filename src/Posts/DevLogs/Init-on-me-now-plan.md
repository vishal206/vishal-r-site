Have you ever tried to be productive? Have you ever tried to set up a calendar to schedule your tasks, activities, habits, or even the time you’re going to take a bath?
It works fine for a day, or even a week, but there comes a point where you mess up one activity, and like a cute little domino, your tasks come crashing down. Then comes your “fuck it, I’ll go with the flow” phase, followed by nothing getting done, and eventually, you’re back at the starting line.

This has happened to me a lot, the domino fall of my tasks. So why not a calendar that adapts to your crashes? A calendar that understands your priorities and knows how to manage your tasks when you fail at one. This feels like a good use case for AI, right?
