What everyone wants in life? What is the ultimate goal?

**Happiness.** ✨

Does money make everyone happy? Then are all the rich people happy?
I’m richer than I was in school, but I’m not happier.
(TBH, I was happier back then.)

So what do I think gives happiness?
Good health — Freedom — Strong Relationships.

I know, I know… With money, I can buy health and freedom — But only when money is properly used.

# ⏱️:💸 Reducing My Time-Money Dependency
Currently, in my life, and for most people reading this, making money is proportional to the time we spend.
That is, working Monday to Friday, and getting 2 days for yourself. A 5:2 life.

I believe that to improve my life, I need to reduce this dependency. I need to make money less dependent on how much time I spend earning it, which in turn gives me more time for myself.
(Because I’ll need that time to build health and freedom.)

Now, is it wrong to live a 5:2 life? 
No.
It helps you learn, grow, and understand a lot. But these are generally fixed — and not in your control.
This life isn't great, but it isn’t bad either.

# 💔 Break up time and money couple

I want to build a startup or a business that only needs 2 days a week of my attention (2:5).

But I can’t be sure I’ll reach 2:5. I might need to spend 7 days a week building it and making it generate money (7:0). But here’s the key: 
this isn’t fixed.
There’s hope.
It can be manipulated.

There might be a Get Rich Quick” way. But don’t misunderstand it as “Get Rich Easy.”


# 😶‍🌫️ Not All Businesses Are the Same
These days, I see people starting businesses — Let’s say, a small cake shop on Church Street. But what’s the point if you have to stand in the shop from morning to evening?
Here, I don’t see the hope of break the time–money love.

Not all businesses will take you to 2:5. So how do you find the right one? Make sure your idea has CENTS.

**CENTS** — Control, Entry, Need, Time, and Scale.

With this I conclude that Money can buy happiness, but only when earned and spent in a right way.
