Yo 🙋‍♂️!

I just found a new Christmas movie.
A movie released before you were born that will make you cherish the life you have. 2 hours about a man, getting what he deserved for being good. I recommend it if you are feeling your life is racing by, and you need a cozy ending slice of life movie. And won’t recommend it if you have a friend or relative pressing you for a loan, this movie might(might) make you give up your money.

Movie: It’s a Wonderful Life (1946)
You can watch it for free in [plex.tv](https://watch.plex.tv/en-GB/watch/movie/its-a-wonderful-life). Use Brave if you want to block ads 😉

It started with God assigning an angel to help a good man stop making wrong decisions. This good man, George Bayle, sacrificed his dreams. He didn’t run to help people; he was in a position to help people. He could choose a path, take the train, live the dream life, or help people by just staying. And he chose to stay; that is all we have to do.

This movie made me think, **is it real?** Will people help me back if I help them? But can I or anyone help someone unconditionally? If it means giving away money that you saved! Is it possible to think of money as less than someone else’s burden when you had to go through a burden to save up that money?
Leave money, that may not be the only thing to show your love. There is a scene where he saves a man’s dignity just by keeping quiet about it for the rest of his life. Can we do that at least, rather than gossiping the moment we get spicy news?

The movie ends with _“Remember no man is a failure who has friends.”_ Do you have friends? If you are reading this, you are my friend.
