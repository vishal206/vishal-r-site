    <p>I see this picture of my favorite character Luffy from One Piece—a happy, free-living person jumping toward his dreams and goals while taking great pleasure in his journey—I feel inspired.</p>
    <p>I saw a poster of him holding his goggles with a huge smile on his face in his freedom form, and I thought, "This is it." This represents the life I want to have.</p>

I started using this as my profile picture everywhere, and it stuck with me as stickers and posters. Every time I see it, I smile. I get that same spark in my eyes that I see in Luffy. This always reminds me to "Enjoy the journey with that smile."

Now I want to use this totem everywhere as something that represents me, but can I use it? I don't want to infringe on any copyrights. I want to create something inspired by this—a logo, a sticker, and a stamp that goes on all my books and devices that says "This belongs to Vishal" with my totem on top.
