Recently I have updated my morning routine to something that I'm proud of, so here I'm to boost it.

1. First thing (after all the essentials), I do a leetcode question every day. This takes me roughly around 45 mins. Yes I'm a bit above noob at this space. Why this habit? Recently I realized I'm bad at gaming, I lose a lot, gaming is making me more frustrated than enjoying it. After some inner exploration I realized that I used to enjoy doing **competitive programming** during my studies, so I started with getting my CP game back on, but I was lacking, had to revise a lot of algorithms and data structure to compete. I started with doing 1 problem every day. I'm following a list from leetcode, it comes with multiple solutions, helps me explore. Now I have a 19 day streak. I can see it reflecting in my contest performance, now I'm in top 52 percent. Will do a detailed blog when I reach top 10 percent.

2. Next I head to **gym**, I'm still working on it. There are days when I missed to go but overall happy with the progress. Finally my body is set to the exercise that I don't get sore muscle cramps.

3. My **adventure to office** starts now. I have to board metro. Now I have 2 paths:  
   1. Walk to metro station  
   2. Take an auto  
I created a rule that I wait 10 mins for auto. If I get one confirmed by then I take it. Mostly it gets cancelled or no one picks it, and after this 10 mins bracket I start to walk to metro station. Walking is not so bad, I just have to stay in shade and walk slow so that I don't get sweaty.

4. Now the **metro journey**, usually it's peaceful. My stop is one of the last stops, so it is empty and I get a seat. Now I have to sit for the next 35 mins till I reach MG Road. Get crampy after Majestic. Thank God I don't have to change line.

5. A small walk to my office.

After following the 1st and 2nd for almost 20 days, I have realized that it is easy to follow a habit when I'm not focusing on the goal. Simply that day starts with today I'm gonna do 1 question. I don't think of all the goals that I want to achieve with this like finishing a list or getting good at it. Simply focus on one thing today and this mind set did help. This keeps my mind clear and easy to decide the moves.

When I created this routine I didn't want to add a constraint with time. In past I put I go to gym at 7:00 am. A day I wake up at 9 am and my whole routine is ruined. With my updated routine, independent of the wake up time, I do a problem and head to gym. There are times I might get late to office. On those days I reduce the time I spend in gym and solve an easy question.

As a future plan, I'm planning to add reading book and working on projects to my daily quests.
