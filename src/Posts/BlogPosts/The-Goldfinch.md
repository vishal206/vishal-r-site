A painting that survives. The painting that lived. A painter dies in an accidental explosion. Only survivor is a bird painted — a bird tied at a place. After time, the bird gets into a terrorist explosion in an art museum. Yet again, it survives in the hands of a child.
But a work of art surviving through time, preserved, handed down from one to another, doesn’t belong to an individual. Does it come back to everyone’s eye! To tell people to survive! To tell people being tied is not an excuse!

Movie: The Goldfinch.

I just had an immersive movie experience. Did shout at my friend for trying to talk in the middle ( sorry again if you are reading this ). The actors, every single one, were great. I believe a book or movie works only when we feel the character’s emotion. I felt every little emotion of the characters. I didn’t cry; actually, no one in the movie cried. But I felt my tears behind my eyes, maybe my anger at reality. Life uh!
