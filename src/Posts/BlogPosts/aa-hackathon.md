# 🗓️ The Day:

On the day of **26 July 2025, 09:30 AM** started a 30-hour hackathon. My first full-night hackathon I pulled. Around **700 teams** were shortlisted out of supposedly **3000 teams** who submitted their idea. Yes, they made a **Guinness World Record** with the maximum number of hackathon participants (really, we witnessed the Guinness record given to them).

It started with a huge line of participants entering the arena and getting assigned their tables. It was a hassle for the volunteers, but kudos — they pulled it off nice. And the **HACKATHON BEGINS**.

# 💡 Idea Submission:

Around **34 days** before the day, I came across a hackathon conducted by **Google** and **Hack2Skill** and shared it with my only friend, the team leader with whom I won a hackathon — **Sadhana Das**. With this, team **Hackemon**, with two members, rises again.

After some discussion, we concluded on giving it a shot. We registered. One fine weekend we decided to sit and come up with an idea to submit. The first challenge: _"Managing City Data Overload"_, bulb glows and the discussion begins with glowing faces.

After a lot of discussions and a lot of scribbling in my tab, we came up with a product that solves the challenge. The idea is:

**Geo+**, a **Gemini-powered, multimodal AI agent** that monitors, understands, and responds to real-time city events using citizen-submitted reports and AI reasoning. By combining intelligent prioritization, fraud detection, and geo-aware alerts, it delivers a live dashboard that empowers both commuters and city authorities to make faster, safer decisions.

Perfect for smart city rollouts, mobility partners, and emergency response networks.

# 🚀 Hackathon Begins:

After enjoying my **idli** and **2 varieties of chutneys**, we started our app build — but the Wi-Fi was down, the mobile network was down for everyone. The only light in the cave was an **Ethernet cable** on the table.

At my table, we had 4 teams with 2 members each. A team with 2 second-year girls from Coimbatore was using it. Management promised a fix in some time. Till then, my team went on a **plan of action discussion**, came up with steps to take — along with **chocolates, nuts, and sodas**.

Another light in the cave: whoever used Windows laptops got the Wi-Fi connected. Unfortunately, my team was using Macs, but fortunately, the girls' team had Windows — so the Ethernet cable got free and I took it.

We started the build but not everyone was building — people were still asking for the Wi-Fi to be back.

**Lunch came and dinner came.**  
After stretching on the bean bags, saw the time was **11 PM**, found ourselves a physical activity — walk around the arena.

An announcement from the management:

- No checkpoint till tomorrow 9:30 AM
- Final submission pushed to 12
- Due to the Wi-Fi problem, **a new prize category** for "Best Idea" was added
- This update woke up a lot of people with **new energy that Red Bull didn't give**

An addition to my achievements: I **pulled an all-nighter** developing the app, thanks to **Augment AI** in VS Code helping me during hard times. Also, thanks to the **Google mentors** in the **Agentic help room** for guiding and the nice talk I had.

Learnt a lot on how to use **Google’s ecosystem** for Agents and LLMs with their **Firebase** and **Cloud**.

Had my midnight snack and judged people sleeping in the arena (no offence). There were people who came prepared with **bedsheets nicely done**. By **7 AM**, I wrapped up my project, got refreshed, and stood in line for **10 mins to use the toilet**.

# 📤 Final Submission:

Due to the fact that we wrapped up the development and PPT to be submitted, we took a chill time, walked through the arena, went out to check the place where the final pitching would happen.

We came back to the table to realize **mentor checkpoints had started**, we had **2 hours** for final submission, and the **PPT format was different** for the final submission.

After a hustle of **45 mins**, Sadhana pulled it off and wrapped up the PPT to submit.

Now the problem was the **time mentors take to conduct the checkpoint**. As time passed and the mentors were nowhere in sight — even after submission — we had to wait through lunch. People lost patience (we too), tired and exhausted through the night.

We realized our team was the **last** to give the checkpoint, and the time finally came.

Two mentors came who said, _“Don’t explain your idea, just show the prototype.”_ Still, we went ahead with explaining the idea a bit and tried showing the prototype — one mentor left the spot and another asked questions and expected **one-word answers** for brief questions.

Was it rushed? Yes.

We felt that this could have been done better with a proper **brief on our solution**.

# 🏁 Result:

After the hustle of the checkpoint pitch, we had our lunch and walked around to look up on ourselves.

Got to know a team from our table named **Refi** (hope I'm correct) got shortlisted for the final pitch. They were a team of 2 — one did an **MBA in a fancy French university** and another a **Data Scientist with 3 years of experience**. I had my small talks with them throughout the days, enjoying the time.

**Happy and proud** that a tablemate of ours got shortlisted.

Our category result came — **we were not shortlisted**. Not surprised.

Came out of the arena with packed bags and a promise to **do better at the next hackathon we go**.

And we said to ourselves: **we had a good day.**

# 🧠 Key Takeaways:

- Know your **USP** well.
- If the hackathon is conducted by a **community based on a product** or **focused on a product**, make sure to use it as much as you can. This might have **weightage equal to the idea** itself.
- Attend **more hackathons**.

This made me realize:  
**I can pull off a version 1 development in 24 hours. I'm strong.**

💪✨
