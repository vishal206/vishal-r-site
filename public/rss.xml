            <description><![CDATA[ Hi! Welcome to my Weekly Note nummbbberrr 7 ✨

- This week I went **go-karting** for the first time. My great friends Sadhana and Mayank took me to **LOCO BEAR**. During a break, Mayank asked, “Let’s go for karting.” I acted casually “Sure, Sadhana, you’re coming too” but damn, my heart was on fire...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[
Recently I have updated my morning routine to something that I'm proud of, so here I'm to boost it.

1. First thing (after all the essentials), I do a leetcode question every day. This takes me roughly around 45 mins. Yes I'm a bit above noob at this space. Why this habit? Recently I realized I'm b...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[- Feeling proud that I didn’t take any leave this week even though none of my teammates showed up. One thing that stopped me is that this month I already had 5 office closures, so I’m planning to save the leaves for next month (no office closures 😭).

- Celebrated the **1-year anniversary of the 11 AM Club**, started with paper cutting where the creativity juice flows. I couldn't finalize what to make, every cut I made gave me a new idea. Anyway, I ended up with a unique-looking piece by the end. As usual, Bake Duck got an exquisite cake, this t...]]></description>

- Got my **IKEA delivery!** Finally received the ALGANÄS shoe stand that I’d been waiting for quite some time , loved it! I was afraid it would be *wobbly-wobbly* 😅 but it turned out super steady and slim, so it doesn’t take up much space.  
  Also grabbed a few other small things along with two c...]]></description>

What everyone wants in life? What is the ultimate goal?

**Happiness.** ✨

Does money make everyone happy? Then are all the rich people happy?
I’m richer than I was in school, but I’m not happier.
(TBH, I was happier back then.)

So what do I think gives happiness?
