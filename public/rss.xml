A painting that survives. The painting that lived. A painter dies in an accidental explosion. Only survivor is a bird painted — a bird tied at a place. After time, the bird gets into a terrorist explosion in an art museum. Yet again, it survives in the hands of a child.
But a work of art surviving ...]]></description>

Have you ever tried to be productive? Have you ever tried to set up a calendar to schedule your tasks, activities, habits, or even the time you’re going to take a bath?
It works fine for a day, or even a week, but there comes a point where you mess up one activity, and like a cute little domino, yo...]]></description>

Konnichiwa Readers!

Last month, I attended an event I found through my regular magazine, **Open Source For You**.  
If you like holding a physical magazine that talks about tech, especially the soft side of tech changes, I recommend this one.

Recently I have updated my morning routine to something that I'm proud of, so here I'm to boost it.

1. First thing (after all the essentials), I do a leetcode question every day. This takes me roughly around 45 mins. Yes I'm a bit above noob at this space. Why this habit? Recently I realized I'm b...]]></description>

Recently, I’ve been working with a friend of mine on building a lifestyle brand that currently focuses on clothing, skincare, and related food habits.

Started working on the skincare POC,

What everyone wants in life? What is the ultimate goal?

**Happiness.** ✨

Does money make everyone happy? Then are all the rich people happy?
